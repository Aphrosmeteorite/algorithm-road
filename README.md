# 👋Hi There

***This is a repository for documenting my algorithmic learning***

## `Tree`

+ ◽️ Data Structure
+ ◽️ Algorithm Question & Solutions
+ ◽️ Learning Notes
+ ◽️ CMake Tool
+ 🤔 maybe there can be more···

## `CMake`

if you want to use `CMake` to build the project, you can use the following commands in the root directory of the project:

```shell
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build .
```

After that, you can find the executable file in the `build` directory.

## or you can also

run the command in the root folder of this project and it will make the `build` folder and tell you which one you want to build and run.

```shell
$ ./run.sh
```
